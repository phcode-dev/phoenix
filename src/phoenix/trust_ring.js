/**
 * KernalModeTrust is a security mechanism in Phoenix that provides a trust base for core components before any
 * extensions are loaded. It establishes a secure communication channel between core modules and the Tauri shell,
 * preventing unauthorized access to sensitive information by extensions or other potentially malicious code.
 *
 * ## Purpose
 *
 * The primary purposes of KernalModeTrust are:
 *
 * 1. **Secure Boot Process**: Ensures that the application can only boot with a properly initialized trust ring.
 * 2. **Secure Communication**: Enables core modules to communicate securely without worrying about interception by
 *    extensions.
 * 3. **API Key Management**: Provides secure storage and retrieval of Phoenix API keys.
 * 4. **Security Boundary**: Creates a clear security boundary between trusted core components and potentially untrusted
 *    extensions.
 *
 * ## Implementation Details
 *
 * ### Trust Ring Initialization
 *
 * The trust ring is initialized at boot time before any extensions are loaded:
 *
 * 1. Random AES-256 keys and initialization vectors (IV) are generated using the Web Crypto API.
 * 2. These cryptographic materials are stored in the `window.KernalModeTrust` object.
 * 3. The trust relationship is established with the Tauri backend via the `initTrustRing()` function.
 *
 * The trust ring has several important security characteristics:
 *
 * 1. **Memory-Only Storage**: The random AES key-based trust ring is only kept in memory and never persisted to disk.
 * 2. **One-Time Use**: The trust ring is designed for one-time use and is discarded after serving its purpose.
 * 3. **Session Lifetime**: It is maintained in memory only until the end of the Phoenix session.
 * 4. **Tauri Communication**: The trust keys are communicated to the Tauri shell at boot time.
 * 5. **API Response Encryption**: Once an AES key is trusted by the Tauri shell, all sensitive API responses will be
 *   encrypted with this key. This means extensions can still call sensitive APIs but will receive only encrypted
 *   garbage responses without access to the trust key.
 *
 * ### Security Model
 *
 * KernalModeTrust implements a strict security model:
 *
 * 1. **Boot-time Only Access**: The trust ring is only available to code that loads before any extensions.
 * 2. **One-time Trust**: For a given Tauri window, the trust ring can only be set once.
 * 3. **Deliberate Removal**: Before extensions are loaded, `window.KernalModeTrust` is deleted to prevent extensions
 *    from accessing it.
 * 4. **Dismantling Before Restart**: The trust ring must be dismantled before restarting the application. This is a
 *    critical security requirement. If not dismantled, the old trust keys will still be in place when the page reloads,
 *    but the application will lose access to them (as they were only stored in memory). As a result, the Tauri shell
 *    will not trust any sensitive API calls from the reloaded page, as these calls will rely on the old keys that the
 *    new page instance cannot access. This security measure intentionally prevents any page reload from maintaining
 *    trust without explicitly dismantling the old trust ring first, ensuring that malicious code cannot bypass
 *    security by simply reloading the window.
 *
 * ### Cryptographic Implementation
 *
 * KernalModeTrust uses strong cryptography:
 *
 * 1. **AES-256 Encryption**: Uses AES-256 in GCM mode for secure encryption/decryption.
 * 2. **Random Key Generation**: Cryptographically secure random number generation for keys and IVs.
 * 3. **Secure Key Storage**: Keys are stored securely in the Tauri backend(which is stored in OS keychain).
 *
 * ## Security Considerations
 *
 * 1. **Extension Isolation**: Extensions should never have access to KernalModeTrust to prevent potential security
 *    breaches.
 *
 * 2. **One-time Trust**: The trust ring can only be set once per Tauri window, preventing malicious code from replacing
 *    it.
 *
 * 3. **Complete Dismantling**: When dismantling the keyring, it's recommended to reload the page immediately to prevent
 *    any potential exploitation of the system.
 *
 * 4. **Test Environment Handling**: Special handling exists for test environments to ensure tests can run properly
 *    without compromising security.
 *
 * ## Conclusion
 *
 * KernalModeTrust is a critical security component in Phoenix that establishes a trust boundary between core components
 * and extensions. By providing secure communication channels and API key management, it helps maintain the overall
 * security posture of the application.
