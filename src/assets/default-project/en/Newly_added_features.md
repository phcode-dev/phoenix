# Newly Added Features

We are continuously adding features every week to improve the life of web developers.
<a href="https://github.com/phcode-dev/phoenix/releases" target="_blank">Check out our release page!</a>

Here's a list of top features recently added to Phoenix:

## Safari Support (Beta)
`Added on May,2023`

Safari browser support is now in beta! Stay tuned for our **upcoming Web and native Mac/iOS apps** for full support. 

### A note to Safari users
Safari automatically deletes website data if a site is not revisited within 7 days.
Phoenix relies on browser storage to save your projects, which may be removed due to this policy.
**To prevent data loss**, please **download** your projects before closing the tab or stay tuned for our **upcoming Web and native Mac/iOS apps** for full support.

## Firefox Support
`Added on April,2023`

phcode.dev now compatible with Firefox! Although opening local folders is not yet supported,
you can import projects from GitHub. Stay tuned for upcoming support for uploading local folders.
