# Claude Code Instructions

## Git Commits
- Use Conventional Commits format: `type(scope): description` (e.g. `fix: ...`, `feat: ...`, `chore: ...`).
- Keep commit subject lines concise; use the body for detail.
- Never include `Co-Authored-By` lines in commit messages.

## Code Style
- 4-space indentation, never tabs.
- Always use semicolons.
- Brace style: (`if (x) {`), single-line blocks allowed.
- Always use curly braces for `if`/`else`/`for`/`while`.
- No trailing whitespace.
