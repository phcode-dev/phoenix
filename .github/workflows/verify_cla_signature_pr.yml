# The pull request target event provides RW token to github 
# https://github.blog/2020-08-03-github-actions-improvements-for-fork-and-pull-request-workflows/
# But `on: pull_request_target` should be avoided due to security
# reasons. Read more: [SEC_ADV_1] https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/
# 
# We will use a mix of github pull_request that does not provide any write access to pull requests on forks
# and workflow event, as discussed in [SEC_ADV_1]
