## Tenets
1. Targeted for web development. Js, html and CSS enjoy special status.
2. Light-weight editor.
3. Extension support maintaining full compatibility with Brackets extensions (except brackets-node extensions).
4. Uncompromised local development experience.
5. Support for pluggable remote back-ends.
6. Phoenix core will work from a static web server.

## Status
Phoenix is in alpha and is under active development.

## Building Phoenix
[Source Repository](https://github.com/aicore/phoenix) 

* Require widows for builds in the port window.
* Have brackets installed in windows
* use nodejs version for windows less than node v6.10
* run `npm install --force`
* Use a web server and navigate in browser to `src/index.html`

## Acknowledgements
* Phoenix is based on the Brackets code editor by Adobe. Find out more on [Adobe Brackets here](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/).
* Inspired by previous work from the [Mozilla Thimble](https://github.com/mozilla/thimble.mozilla.org) project to port brackets to the web. https://github.com/mozilla/brackets
* In browser server based on [nohost](https://github.com/humphd/nohost) by https://github.com/humphd/
